# React Rectangles App

The React Rectangles App is a simple web application that allows users to create and manipulate rectangles on a canvas. Users can drag and position rectangles within the canvas, add new rectangles with random sizes and colors, and view the JSON representation of the rectangles.

## Features

- Add rectangles: Click the "Add rectangle" button to add a new rectangle to the canvas. The rectangle will have a random size, position, and color.
- Drag and position: Click and drag rectangles to reposition them within the canvas. Rectangles are constrained to stay within the canvas boundaries.
- JSON representation: Click the "Print JSON" button to view the JSON representation of the rectangles in a preformatted section below the canvas.
- Interactive canvas: The canvas provides an interactive environment for creating, dragging, and managing rectangles.

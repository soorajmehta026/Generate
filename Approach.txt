## Overview

The React Rectangle Drawer App is a single-page application designed to demonstrate basic interaction with rectangles on a canvas. It utilizes React's state management and event handling mechanisms to allow users to add, drag, and interact with rectangles. The app provides a visually interactive experience and showcases the JSON representation of rectangles.

## Components

### App Component

The `App` component is the root component of the application. It manages the overall state of the app, including the list of rectangles, selected rectangle index, dragging information, and the visibility of the JSON view. The component structure includes buttons for adding rectangles and printing JSON, as well as conditional rendering of the canvas and JSON view.

### Canvas and Rectangle Components

The rectangles are represented as `div` elements within the `canvas` element. Each rectangle is positioned absolutely within the canvas and can be dragged by updating their `left` and `top` CSS properties. Each rectangle's appearance is determined by its width, height, color, and zIndex. A border is added to the selected rectangle.

## User Interactions

### Adding Rectangles

1. When the "Add rectangle" button is clicked, a new rectangle is generated with random dimensions, colors, and positions. The rectangle's `x` and `y` positions are calculated to fit within the canvas while staying visible.

### Dragging Rectangles

1. When the user clicks on a rectangle and holds the mouse button down, the `onPointerDown` event handler is triggered.
2. The event handler calculates the offset between the mouse click and the top-left corner of the rectangle.
3. The `onPointerMove` event handler tracks the mouse movement and updates the rectangle's position accordingly.
4. The rectangle's new position is calculated based on the cursor's position and the offset, ensuring it stays within the canvas boundaries.

### Viewing JSON

1. When the "Print JSON" button is clicked, the `printRectanglesAsJson` function is called, which sets the `showJson` state to `true`.
2. The JSON representation of the rectangles array is displayed using the `<pre>` tag with the `JSON.stringify` function, indented for readability.

## Conclusion

The React Rectangle Drawer App demonstrates the fundamental concepts of building interactive web applications using React. It showcases the use of components, state management, event handling, and conditional rendering to create a visually engaging and user-friendly experience. This app can serve as a starting point for more complex applications that involve interactive graphics and user interactions.
